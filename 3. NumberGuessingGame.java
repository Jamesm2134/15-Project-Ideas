/* 
 * This is a simple game that can help you get your feet wet with Java. 
 * The game is relatively simple â€” the computer generates a random number, 
 * and the user must guess the number. The computer will then let the user 
 * know that their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This can be free-form, 
 * allowing an unlimited number of guesses, or give the user a set number of guesses 
 * before the game ends. Number guessing games involve some Java programming basics like
 *  accepting inputs from the user, creating classes, and using conditional statements. 
 *  GeeksforGeeks offers a number guessing game walkthrough that can help you get started.
