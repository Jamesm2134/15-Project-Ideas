1. Sum A + B
A sum-based project is a great way to get started with Java programming. The project is quite simple â€” the user will input two numbers (which are treated 
		as the variables A and B), and the program will add them together and present the sum of A + B. This can help you learn to work with methods and integers. 
JavaTPoint offers a great guide for a Sum A + B project, and working through this type of project can help you become familiar with Java processes.
