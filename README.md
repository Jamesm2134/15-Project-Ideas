I am going to work through each project through this bootcamp at [ https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/blog/java-projects-for-beginners-to-gain-skills/ } 
( 15 projects )

The projects start out simple and get harder each time.

while working on the code, I will be leaving comments explaining what things do and what things mean to help better explin what is happening
